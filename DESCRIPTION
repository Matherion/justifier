Description: This package leverages the 'yum' package to
             implement a 'YAML' standard for documenting
             justifications, such as for decisions taken during the
             planning, execution and analysis of a study or during the
             development of a behavior change intervention. These
             justifications are both human- and machine-readable,
             facilitating efficient extraction and organisation.
